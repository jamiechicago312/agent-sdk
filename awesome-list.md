## Hackathon Projects

*Projects from the AI Agents Hackathon - showcasing creative uses of OpenHands SDK + MCP integration*

### üéØ Featured Project

- **[Notion Blog Demo](https://github.com/jamiechicago312/agent-sdk/tree/ai-agent-hackathon-demo/examples/notion-blog-demo)** - Automated blog generation system that connects to Notion via MCP OAuth, extracts content from pages/databases, and generates a complete HTML/CSS/JS blog site. Demonstrates full workflow from content creation to web publishing. [Repository](https://github.com/jamiechicago312/agent-sdk/tree/ai-agent-hackathon-demo/examples/notion-blog-demo)

### Enterprise & Productivity

- **SlackFlow Agent** - AI agent that integrates Slack, GitHub, and Google Calendar MCP servers to automate project updates, schedule meetings based on code commits, and generate team status reports.

- **DataSync Pro** - Database intelligence agent using PostgreSQL and SQLite MCP servers to synchronize data across systems, detect inconsistencies, and generate automated reports.

### Web & Content

- **WebHarvester** - Content aggregation agent using Fetch and Puppeteer MCP servers to monitor competitor websites, extract pricing data, and generate market intelligence reports.

- **SEO Optimizer** - Website analysis agent that crawls sites using Browser MCP, analyzes content structure, and generates SEO improvement recommendations with automated fixes.

### Development & DevOps

- **GitFlow Assistant** - Development workflow agent integrating GitHub MCP to automate code reviews, manage pull requests, and maintain coding standards across repositories.

- **Deploy Commander** - CI/CD automation agent using SSH and Docker MCP servers to manage deployment pipelines, monitor system health, and handle automated rollbacks.

### Finance & Analytics

- **Market Intelligence** - Financial analysis agent using public API MCP servers to fetch market data, analyze trends, and generate investment research reports with risk assessments.

- **Expense Tracker Pro** - Personal finance agent that connects to banking APIs via MCP to categorize transactions, track budgets, and generate spending insights.

### IoT & Smart Systems

- **Smart Home Hub** - Home automation agent using MQTT and Home Assistant MCP servers to control IoT devices, monitor energy usage, and automate routines based on occupancy patterns.

- **Industrial Monitor** - Manufacturing oversight agent that processes sensor data via MCP, detects equipment anomalies, and triggers predictive maintenance workflows.

### Education & Learning

- **Code Mentor** - Educational assistant agent that accesses documentation via MCP, reviews student code, provides personalized feedback, and tracks learning progress across programming languages.

- **Research Assistant** - Academic support agent using web search and document MCP servers to gather research materials, summarize papers, and generate bibliographies for students.
